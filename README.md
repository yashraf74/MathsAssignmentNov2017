# MathsAssignmentNov2017
This repository contains a project I had as an assignment to implement: some operations on matrices, sets, and some proofs using C++. There's a table containing all of the required tasks and how to implement them.
*Note that I couldn't implement task no. 5 & 6 because of an issue I encountered while implementing task no. 4; the function that calculates the reduced echelon form didn't work quite as I expected it to be, especially with bigger dimensions of the augmented matrix.*
*And since that I was going to implement that function "echform() for short" to calculate the inverse of a given matrix, and to furthermore calculate the value of the determinant of that matrix, I didn't even try to implement those tasks since that this would cause serious errors and wrong outputs (obviously).

Each task is represented in a class on it's own (I was running short on time), refer to "source.cpp" to know which class accounts for which task.
